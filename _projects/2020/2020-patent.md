description: >-
    This project, conducted in collaboration with a textile engineering research team, proposed a novel design method for Jacquard fabrics that integrates both grayscale image simulation and hidden information embedding. The technique utilizes combinations of English letters and Arabic numerals to encode visual patterns that are imperceptible to the human eye but embedded within the grayscale representation of the fabric.
