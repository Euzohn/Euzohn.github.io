description: >-
    This project aims to predict the listing prices of second-hand sailboats using machine learning methods, including Neural Networks, Random Forest, LGBM, and XGBoost. After data collection and preprocessing, model performance is evaluated through learning curve comparison, with LGBM chosen for its accuracy and good fit. The analysis focuses on regional effects on sailboat pricing, exploring variations by geographic area and model type. Additionally, a regional simulation model is developed to predict second-hand sailboat prices in Hong Kong based on economic and freight indicators. Statistical methods like paired sample T-tests are used to analyze pricing differences between monohulls and catamarans.
