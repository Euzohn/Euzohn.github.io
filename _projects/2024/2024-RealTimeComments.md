    This project focuses on the intersection of AI, management science and e-commerce, applying deep learning to live - streaming e - commerce. I proposed the RCGA - Net model to extract sentiment features and classify evaluation objects in comments. I collected real - world data from TikTok live - streaming rooms, including comments and sales figures, to analyze the impact of comment features on sales.
