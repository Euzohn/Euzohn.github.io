    The Intelligent Traffic Asset Management System leverages advanced computer vision and deep learning technologies, such as YOLO for object detection and DeepSORT for multi-object tracking, to automatically detect, track, and match road signs and traffic assets. This system enables the automated recognition of traffic signs, enhances real-time tracking, and provides accurate data for efficient traffic management. The system integrates various components, including image pre-processing, object detection, feature extraction, tracking, and sign matching, to streamline traffic asset management for urban infrastructure and intelligent transportation systems.
